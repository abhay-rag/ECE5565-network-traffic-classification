Link to the Aposemat IoT-23 dataset: https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23

The data preperation and advanced data preparation files are used to preprocess the conn.log.labeled files from the Aposemat IoT-23 dataset. 

To examine how we trained each model and recoreded each metric, please look into the model.ipynb file. Note, that if you download the file, some of the files names will need to be changed and the groupby function should be commited out if you wish to use a unbiased dataset, unequal number of labels.

PCAP files were too big to be added to the dataset.
